    Custom Google Cloud Storage backend that returns public URLs without signing.
    
    This is the ENTERPRISE solution for buckets with uniform bucket-level access
    and public read permissions. It avoids the private key requirement for signed URLs.
    
    Use this when:
    - Your bucket has uniform bucket-level access enabled
    - Your bucket allows public read access (allUsers: roles/storage.objectViewer)
    - You don't need temporary/expiring URLs
    - You want maximum performance (no signing overhead)

        Return the public URL to access a given file from the storage.
        
        This overrides the default behavior that tries to generate signed URLs,
        which requires private keys that aren't available with compute engine credentials.
